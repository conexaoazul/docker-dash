# Docker Dash vs Komodo — honest comparison

## TL;DR

- **Komodo** wins if you run a fleet of Docker hosts and want to deploy stacks across all of them from Git, with build-and-deploy pipelines as a first-class primitive.
- **Docker Dash** wins on single-host (or 1–3 host) depth: security scanning, audit, hardening, and remediation built into the dashboard itself.
- They target different shapes of infrastructure. This is not a head-to-head replacement.

## What Komodo does better

Komodo (formerly Monitor) is built around a clear thesis: a fleet of servers, deployed and kept in sync from Git. That shows up in the product:

- **Stacks-from-Git as the core primitive.** Define a stack in a repo, point Komodo at it, and every server in the fleet stays in sync. Docker Dash supports Git deploys, but it does not treat "the cluster's state lives in Git" as the canonical source of truth.
- **Build-and-deploy pipelines.** Komodo can build images on a builder host and roll them out across servers as part of a single workflow. Docker Dash builds images locally but doesn't orchestrate cross-host build pipelines.
- **Server fleet management UX.** The whole UI is shaped around "many servers, many stacks." Adding the 10th server feels the same as the 2nd. In Docker Dash, multi-host is supported but the product's center of gravity is the host you're currently looking at.
- **Rust backend + binary distribution.** Single statically-linked binary, fast cold start, low overhead. If you care about runtime efficiency on the orchestration layer itself, Komodo's stack is leaner than a Node.js dashboard.
- **Integrated alerter system.** Stack/server health alerts (Slack, Discord, generic webhook) are wired into the same model that drives deployments — one place for "what's deployed" and "what's broken."

If your problem is "I have 10 VPSes and I want one dashboard that deploys stacks across all of them on Git push," Komodo is the more direct fit.

## What Docker Dash ships that Komodo treats lightly (or not at all)

Docker Dash is not trying to be a fleet orchestrator. The depth goes in a different direction:

- **Security scanning bundled in the image** — Trivy, Grype, and Docker Scout, with auto-detect and fallback. No extra tools to install.
- **CIS Docker Benchmark** — one-click hardened container creation (cap_drop ALL, read-only rootfs, no-new-privileges, resource limits) plus per-container CIS findings.
- **Let's Encrypt wizard** with 9 DNS providers for DNS-01 challenges, no manual `acme.sh` plumbing.
- **AI audit log search** — natural-language queries over the audit trail.
- **Registry hygiene pack** — retention policies with dry-run before deletion, plus remote/virtual repository support.
- **Hash-chained audit log** — tamper-evident, with a pCloud backup option that doubles as an external witness for the chain.
- **LDAP / AD / SSO / MFA** — corporate auth wired in, not a separate proxy.
- **84+ bilingual How-To guides** (EN / RO) covering NAS platforms (Synology, Unraid, TrueNAS, QNAP, OMV), VPS providers, and feature workflows.
- **Outbound Network Filter sidecar** — per-container egress allowlist with TLS-SNI + HTTP-Host peek, blocks IMDS by default, no TLS decryption.
- **Container Remediation Wizard** — image-centric findings drill down to running containers and apply fixes scoped to the container.

The pattern: Komodo is wider (more servers), Docker Dash is deeper (more per-container security and operational tooling).

## License

| | Docker Dash | Komodo |
|---|---|---|
| License | MIT | GPL 3.0 |

GPL 3.0 is copyleft — derivative works must also be GPL 3.0. If you plan to embed or extend the dashboard inside a commercial product, MIT is more permissive. For end-users who just run the dashboard as-is, the license rarely matters in practice.

## Performance & footprint

| | Docker Dash v8.2.0 | Komodo |
|---|---|---|
| Image size | ~180MB | Larger (Rust binary + React build assets + Mongo) |
| RAM at idle | ~50MB | Higher (Rust core is lean, but Mongo adds overhead) |
| Default port | 3000 | 9120 (core) |
| Build step | None — vanilla JS, served as-is | Rust binary build + React frontend build |
| Database | SQLite (embedded) | MongoDB (separate service) |
| Dependencies | Just Docker | Docker + MongoDB |

## Pick Komodo if...

- You run a fleet of servers and want GitOps deploys as the primary workflow.
- You already have a Git-driven CD pipeline and want a UI on top of it rather than a separate dashboard model.
- You prefer a Rust backend and don't mind running Mongo as part of the stack.

## Pick Docker Dash if...

- You run 1–3 hosts with a mix of containers, not a fleet — and you want depth on each host rather than breadth across many.
- You want security scanning, audit, CIS hardening, and the Remediation Wizard built into the dashboard, not bolted on.
- You prefer SQLite-embedded simplicity over running Mongo alongside the dashboard.

## Migration notes

Komodo's strong opinion is that stacks live in Git and the dashboard is the executor. If you adopt that model heavily — repos structured around Komodo, builders, and alerter resources — switching back is harder, because Docker Dash doesn't model a fleet that way. Docker Dash is closer to "manage what's already running on this host, and deploy new things from templates, uploads, or Git when you want to" — a less prescriptive shape. Going Docker Dash → Komodo is mostly additive (you keep your containers, add Git-driven workflows on top). Going Komodo → Docker Dash means giving up the fleet-from-Git model and falling back to per-host management.

Different products targeting different use cases. Pick the shape that matches your fleet.
