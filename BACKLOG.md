# Docker Dash — Known Backlog

**Last updated:** 2026-05-05 · Post-v8.2.0 release (pCloud + off-site archives)

This is the single source of truth for deferred work. Each item lists WHY it's deferred (not just WHAT), so future contributors don't waste cycles rediscovering the rationale.

## P1 — Enterprise readiness

### F16 — `ldapjs` replacement with `ldapts`

**Status (updated 2026-04-22):** ✅ Shipped in v6.13.0. `src/services/ldap.js` rewritten against `ldapts`'s Promise-based API; public interface preserved bit-for-bit so no caller changes needed. `ldapjs` and its 9 deprecated `@ldapjs/*` sub-packages fully removed. 740 tests passing (unchanged — no LDAP tests in repo; change statically verified).

**Remaining follow-up (manual staging tests before next enterprise rollout):**
1. OpenLDAP simple bind + search with `userFilter` containing nested `(&(...)(...))`
2. Active Directory bind with quoted CN in DN (`CN="Last, First",OU=...`) — `strictDN: true` default in ldapts may reject what ldapjs accepted
3. AD `memberOf` group-matching case-insensitive substring match
4. LDAPS with self-signed cert + `tlsSkipVerify: true`
5. LDAPS with valid CA + `tlsSkipVerify: false` (no accidental bypass)
6. UTF-8 in username (e.g. `müller`)
7. Username containing `*` / `(` / `)` / `\` (injection-escape path)
8. Connection timeout on unreachable host (~5s)
9. Empty search result handling

**Enterprise LDAP users:** test on staging before updating production. Confidence is medium (code correct per docs, but unverified against a live server).

### F30 — Distributed rate limiter (Redis-backed) — opt-in HA mode

**Status (updated 2026-05-05):** ✅ Fully shipped across the v6.17 → v7.0 → v7.2 series. HA mode is production-ready.

**Final shape:**
- v6.17.0 — `src/services/cluster.js` HA abstraction + Redis-backed rate limiter (`INCR + PEXPIRE` fixed-window) + `docker-compose --profile ha` + `ioredis` as optionalDependencies + 23 mock tests.
- v6.17.1 — WebSocket pub/sub via Redis (fixed "user on replica A misses events from replica B").
- v6.17.2 — Leader election via `SET NX PX` for all cron jobs + Docker event stream + SSH tunnels + git polling.
- v7.0.0 — Operator runbook ([`docs/features/ha-failover-runbook.md`](docs/features/ha-failover-runbook.md)) + sticky-session LB configs ([`docs/features/ha-lb-configs.md`](docs/features/ha-lb-configs.md)) + staging soak verified (3-replica deploy with lock acquire, graceful leader handover, Redis restart recovery). `/api/cluster/status` + 4 Prometheus gauges.
- v7.1.0 — Bundled Prometheus + Grafana observability stack with HA-aware dashboard panels.
- v7.2.0 — In-app Observability Wizard at System → Observability with detect/integrate/deploy paths.

**Multi-replica HA in production is supported as of v7.0.0.** Documented operator runbook covers the failure modes (leader death, rolling restart, Redis failure, split-brain detection, recovery checklist).

## P2 — UX polish

### LE Wizard: WebSocket progress (replace 3s polling)

**Status (updated 2026-04-20):** ✅ Shipped in v6.6.5. Channel `acme:job:<jobId>` broadcasts on each state transition; polling kept as 15s safety net. Service layer stays WS-independent (broadcaster injected at startup).

**Still open:** the pre-existing gap that `acme_jobs.status` never transitions `running → success`. Requires a background Caddy-state watcher. Tracked below.

### LE Wizard: Background watcher for issuance completion

**Status (updated 2026-04-20):** ✅ Shipped in v6.6.6. `src/services/acme-watcher.js` polls every 10s, 60s grace period, 10min hard timeout. 7 unit tests. Publishes via the v6.6.5 WS channel.

### Remediation Wizard: WS progress for live log streaming

**Status (updated 2026-04-20):** ✅ Shipped in v6.6.6. Per-job channel `remediate:job:<id>` broadcasts on every state transition AND every log line. Polling kept as 10s safety net.


### Remediation Wizard: entry points on security.js / stacks.js / cis.js

**Status (updated 2026-04-21):** ✅ Fully shipped. v6.6.3 added CIS + stacks entry points. v6.9.4 closes the `security.js` gap with "Containers using this image" drill-down modal — click the wrench icon on any image scan row → lists running containers using that image → Fix button opens RemediateWizard scoped to container.

### i18n: 25% of keys missing in non-EN locales

**Status (updated 2026-04-21):** ✅ Tooling shipped in v6.11.0. New System → Translations tab integrates Google Translate + DeepL free-tier APIs (500k chars/month each, tracked per-provider/month with hard quota stop) plus a review/export workflow. Keys stay missing until an admin runs auto-translate → reviews → exports the locale file → commits. That's a 10-minute flow per language now instead of "wait for translators."

**What still requires human oversight:** Reviewing machine translations before shipping them. The UI forces per-row Accept/Reject (no bulk accept) precisely so a bad auto-translation doesn't land in production.

---

## P2 — Dependency majors (deferred after 2026-04-20 audit)

**Current state:** npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities after v6.6.4 bump (nodemailer 7→8). All within-major patches applied (dotenv, eslint, puppeteer, simple-git).

Available major upgrades, deliberately not taken:

- ~~**bcrypt 5 → 6**~~ — ✅ shipped in v6.7.1 (native deps refresh). Rebuilt against Node 24.
- ~~**better-sqlite3 11 → 12**~~ — ✅ shipped in v6.7.1 (native deps refresh). Prepared-statement API stayed backward-compatible.
- ~~**diff 5 → 9**~~ — ✅ shipped in v6.10.0. API for `createPatch` stayed compatible across v5→v9; no code change needed beyond `npm install` + overrides bump. All 10 compose-diff tests green.
- ~~**express 4 → 5**~~ — ✅ shipped in v6.14.0. Actually only needed 2 line changes + dropping an obsolete `path-to-regexp: ^0.1.13` override from `overrides` (added for a v4 CVE that's irrelevant on v5 where the transitive dep is `path-to-regexp@8.4.2`). 740 tests passing unchanged. BACKLOG's 8-12h estimate was too pessimistic — real cost was ~2h because the codebase was already v5-idiomatic. Deep-spec at `plans/deep-spec-express5-migration.md` for details.
- ~~**node-cron 3 → 4**~~ — ✅ shipped in v6.9.2. API for `schedule()` / `validate()` / `.stop()` stayed backward-compatible; no call-site changes.
- **helmet 8 → 9** (if/when released) — tracked separately in security audit cycle.

**Proposed approach:** bundle these into one "major-dep bump" session in v6.8+ with a full regression run, not sprinkle them into feature PRs.

## P3 — Operational

### GHCR push permission for custom Caddy image

**Status (updated 2026-04-22):** ✅ Resolved. GHA workflows `caddy-image.yml` and `egress-filter-image.yml` now successfully build + push to `ghcr.io/<owner>/docker-dash-caddy` and `docker-dash-egress-filter` on every tag push. Workflow permissions are configured correctly.

### LE staging integration test in CI

**Status (updated 2026-04-22):** Code shipped in v6.9.2 — `src/__tests__/acme-cloudflare-live.test.js` hits Cloudflare's `/user/tokens/verify` endpoint when `CLOUDFLARE_TEST_TOKEN` env/secret is set. Intentionally skipped (one of the 4 skipped tests in the suite) when the secret is absent.

**Still pending (user action, not code):** provision `CLOUDFLARE_TEST_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret in Repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. After that, the test runs on every push and will catch:
- Credential-validation drift if Cloudflare deprecates token endpoints
- Token revocation / expiry
- Global API Key vs scoped token format regressions

**Effort:** 5 minutes (paste one token into a GHA secret).

### GHA actions on deprecated Node.js 20

**Status (updated 2026-04-22):** ✅ Shipped in v6.13.1. All 4 workflows (`ci.yml`, `docker-build.yml`, `caddy-image.yml`, `egress-filter-image.yml`) bumped to the first Node-24 major of each action: `actions/checkout@v5`, `actions/setup-node@v5`, `docker/setup-qemu-action@v4`, `docker/setup-buildx-action@v4`, `docker/login-action@v4`, `docker/metadata-action@v6`, `docker/build-push-action@v6`. Kept `node-version: '20'` for tests (mirrors the production Dockerfile base image); only the actions' own runtime moved to Node 24.

**Pre-deadline:** was 2026-06-02 GitHub-forced. Done with 40+ days of margin.

### F20 — Retroactive `down()` for 44 existing migrations

**Decision:** NOT doing this. Going forward only. All migrations from 043 onwards have `down()`. Retroactively adding them to 001-042 would be ~1 day of mechanical work with zero operational value (those migrations shipped; no one rolls back to 6.1 by deleting migration 041).

### Multi-host SSH exec channel

**Status (updated 2026-04-20):** ✅ Shipped in v6.8.0. `src/services/ssh-tunnel.js` gained `exec / fileExists / readFile / writeFile`; `src/services/remote-fs.js` dispatches local-vs-remote; `remediate.js` + `docker-runner.js` use remote paths transparently for any `hostId > 0`. Remediation Wizard Apply mode now works end-to-end on remote hosts.

---

## P3 — Nice-to-have

- Sandbox-clone "test fix on copy first" mode for Remediation Wizard
- Cross-stack fleet remediation
- Docker Dash's own `docker update` sandbox for risky updates
- Per-image hint database for Remediation Wizard (crowd-sourced or first-party)
- Scheduled remediation rollouts (apply at 02:00)
- Email/Slack notifications on remediation apply/rollback
- Rollback UX improvements (side-by-side "before vs after" beyond 60s window, by keeping extended snapshots)

---

## P2 — AI roadmap (gated on v8.0.0 production signal)

### AI vulnerability triage

**Status (added 2026-05-05):** Deep-spec drafted in v8.0.0 ([`plans/deep-spec-ai-features.md`](plans/deep-spec-ai-features.md)). Deferred until v8.0.0 audit search has accumulated production signal.

**Acceptance gate before implementation:**
- ≥2 weeks of v8.0.0 audit NL search uptime in real installs
- ≥1 redactor catch on real prompt content (proves the privacy gate works in the wild, not only on the test corpus)
- Zero compliance issues raised by operators

**Scope:** Rank Trivy/Grype scan results by real exploitability via EPSS scores + LLM reasoning over the CVE description + the actual call-site reachability. Read-only — no auto-remediation. Surfaces in Security tab with "Likely exploitable" / "Theoretical" / "False positive in our context" labels.

### AI incident triage

**Status (added 2026-05-05):** Same gate as AI vulnerability triage above.

**Scope:** Container restart-loop diagnosis from `inspect` + last 200 log lines + recent stats. Output: ranked hypothesis ("OOMKilled" / "config error" / "dependency unreachable" / "permission denied on volume mount") with the supporting evidence in each case. Read-only — no auto-restart, no auto-rollback.

### Cosign signature cryptographic verification

**Status (added 2026-04-29):** v8.1.0 surfaces signature *presence* via OCI annotations only — actual `cosign verify` is deferred. Needs cosign binary handling, key management UX, and additional UI affordances. Tracked for a future v8.x minor.

---

## P2 — Architecture refactors (frontend done in v8.2.x waves; backend deferred)

### Frontend "aircraft carrier" splits — DONE in v8.2.x further-split

| File | Was | Now | Modules extracted |
|------|-----|-----|-------------------|
| `public/js/pages/system.js` | 6011 | 2618 | system-egress + system-templates + system-backup + system-ssl + system-cis + system-secrets + system-translations |
| `public/js/pages/settings.js` | 2037 | 572 | settings-users + settings-registries + settings-git + settings-workflows + settings-logforwarding + settings-ldap + settings-ai |

All extracts verified via Puppeteer (12+12 methods present, all tabs render).

### Frontend remaining (lower priority — not strictly necessary)

- `public/js/pages/containers.js` — 3240 LOC (already split once in v6.16.0; still big but list+filter are cohesive)
- `public/js/pages/container-detail.js` — 2718 LOC (already lazy-loaded; could split per tab — Files / Logs / Stats)
- `public/js/pages/images.js` — 1595 LOC (could split list / push / browse)
- `public/js/app.js` — 2051 LOC (init + delegated handlers + routing — split would be cosmetic)

### Backend route splits — DEFERRED

- `src/routes/system.js` — 2827 LOC, 74 routes. Sub-resources: /backup/* (17 routes), /schedules/* (7), /database/* (5), /stacks/* + /compose/* (9), /firewall/* (3).
- `src/routes/misc.js` — 1780 LOC, 42 routes. "Bag of stuff" — /audit, /notifications, /api-keys, /favorites, /health, /metrics.
- `src/routes/containers.js` — 2087 LOC, 65 routes.

**Why deferred:** Express sub-router mounting changes the path resolution. A `/backup/s3-status` route mounted via `app.use('/api/system/backup', backupRouter)` becomes `/s3-status` in the sub-router file. Each split needs careful API regression test (paths, middleware chain, audit invocations). Higher risk-to-value than the frontend split. Schedule a dedicated session per route file.

### How-To content migration to markdown files

**Status (shipped 2026-05-05, partial):** New convention shipped in v8.2.x: `src/db/howto-content/<slug>.md` with YAML front-matter, loaded at startup via `src/services/howto-loader.js`. Existing 84 howtos still live in their original migrations (040, 041, 042, 048, 059) — they continue to work.

**Remaining (not blocking):** Migrate the 84 existing howtos to markdown files piece-by-piece. Each migration is 10 minutes (extract HTML body → wrap in front-matter → drop in `howto-content/`). No regression risk — markdown files OVERWRITE DB rows on next startup.

## P3 — Frontend self-hosting (partial in v8.2.x, full deferred)

### Self-host remaining CDN dependencies

**Status (added 2026-05-05):** Partially shipped in v8.2.x.

**Done:**
- Chart.js 4.4.1 → `public/lib/chart.umd.min.js` (~205 KB). Removes one external CDN dependency. Note: this does NOT eliminate `'unsafe-eval'` from CSP — Chart.js uses `new Function()` internally regardless of where it's served from.

**Deferred:**
- **FontAwesome 6.5.1** (CSS + woff2/woff/ttf font files, ~1.6 MB total). Currently from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`. Self-host requires copying font files + the CSS that references them via relative paths, plus updating `CSP fontSrc` to drop the cdnjs entry. ~30 min work; defer until needed (e.g., if Edge Tracking Prevention starts blocking the cdn).
- **xterm.js 5 + addon-fit** (~600 KB total). Currently from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`. Same pattern — copy + CSS refs + CSP update.
- **Google Fonts** (if used). Check `public/css/app.css` for any `@import` from `fonts.googleapis.com`.

Triggering condition: if jsDelivr or cdnjs becomes unreliable (Edge Tracking Prevention auto-block, regional outage, deprecation), self-host the rest immediately. Until then, the CSP allowlist scoped to those exact CDN hostnames is acceptable.

## P3 — Dependency major bumps (deferred non-blocking)

### dockerode 4 → 5 migration

**Status (added 2026-05-05):** `npm audit --omit=dev` reports one moderate-severity transitive advisory ([GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq) — `uuid <14.0.0` via `dockerode 4.x`). Documented as accepted in [`SECURITY.md` §7](SECURITY.md) — the vulnerable code path (`uuid.v3/v5/v6` with caller-supplied `buf`) is unreachable from how Docker Dash uses dockerode.

**Plan:** Migrate to `dockerode 5.x` in a future release as a clean dependency-bump session, not as a security-driven hotfix. Affects ~40 call sites in `src/services/docker.js`; needs a regression run and possibly minor signature changes.

**Re-trigger:** Re-run `npm audit` quarterly; if the advisory upgrades to high/critical or a new exploit demonstrates reachability through dockerode, treat as urgent.

## How to propose a new item

1. Is it truly blocked (infrastructure / external decision)? → P2 or P3
2. Can it be done in <1 day by a single dev? → P1 or "just do it" in the next session
3. Does it change the product's positioning (e.g., HA mode)? → Major version milestone

For items that become "just do it": open a GitHub issue with the `ready-to-implement` label.
