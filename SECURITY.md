## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **bcrypt** password hashing (12 rounds, configurable)
- **Session tokens** generated with `crypto.randomBytes(32)`, SHA-256 hashed before DB storage
- **Role-based access control** — admin, operator, viewer roles on every endpoint
- **Account lockout** after configurable failed attempts (default: 10) with timed lockout
- **IP-based rate limiting** on login (5/15min) and API endpoints (100/min)
- **SSO support** — Authelia, Authentik, Caddy forward_auth, Traefik (X-Forwarded-User headers)
- **API key authentication** as alternative to session-based auth
- **Forced password change** on first login for default admin
- **Password policy** — minimum 8 characters + at least one digit + common password rejection, enforced via single `validatePassword()` on all password-setting flows (change-password, reset-password, create-user, token-based reset)

### Encryption & Secrets
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for credentials at rest (Git tokens, SSH keys, registry passwords, notification tokens)
- **scrypt KDF** for encryption key derivation (N=16384, r=8, p=1) — not improvised padding
- **Startup validation** — calls `process.exit(1)` in production if APP_SECRET < 32 chars or ENCRYPTION_KEY < 16 chars, or if either matches a known default value
- **No hardcoded credentials** in source code (verified by automated scan)

### Input Validation & Injection Prevention
- **Parameterized SQL** queries everywhere (better-sqlite3 with `?` placeholders)
- **execFileSync** for all shell commands — zero `execSync` with template literal interpolation
- **Input validation middleware** — `validateId`, `validateBody`, `sanitizeBody`
- **Prototype pollution protection** — strips `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` from request bodies
- **Git URL validation** — rejects shell metacharacters (`;&|$(){}`)
- **Compose path validation** — prevents path traversal (`../`)
- **ReDoS protection** — user regex limited to 200 chars with execution timeout
- **Error sanitization** — 5xx errors never leak internal file paths or credentials

### Transport & Headers
- **Helmet.js** security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP)
- **HTTPS** via Caddy reverse proxy (self-signed for internal, Let's Encrypt for public)
- **HSTS** headers via Caddy
- **Cookie flags** — HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict + Secure when HTTPS detected (falls back to SameSite=Lax on plain HTTP)
- **Trust proxy** restricted to loopback in production (prevents IP spoofing)
- **JSON body limit** — 2MB (prevents DoS via large payloads)
- **Request timeout** — 5 minutes (prevents hanging requests)

### Docker Socket Access
- Socket mounted **read-only** (`:ro`) in production docker-compose
- `no-new-privileges` security option enabled
- Feature flags to disable dangerous operations (`ENABLE_EXEC=false`, `READ_ONLY_MODE=true`)
- Audit log for every action with user, timestamp, and IP address

### Monitoring & Detection
- **Audit trail** — every user action logged (create, update, delete, deploy, login)
- **Event-driven notifications** — container crash, OOM kill, health failure auto-sent to Discord/Slack/Telegram
- **Workflow automation** — IF-THEN rules for automated response (restart on crash, notify on high CPU)
- **Daily automated backups** — cron at 02:00, keeps last 7 days

## Testing

- **1122 tests** across 70 test suites (100% passing; 4 skipped are live-Cloudflare ACME integration tests gated on a CI secret)
- Unit tests: crypto round-trip, input validation, shell sanitization, git patterns, AI redactor (33 cases — Bearer/env-assignment/connection-string/tokens/IP/email patterns), retention pure-evaluator (27 cases — 5 safety layers + protected-pattern globs), provenance parser (15 cases — OCI annotation linkifier + cosign presence detector), pCloud HTTP client (16 cases — auth/quota/retry/region routing)
- Integration tests: auth flow (login, session, logout, SSO), API endpoints (supertest), RBAC, security alerts, registry push/browse/delete + retention apply, AI provider abstraction with MockAiProvider, pCloud backup orchestration (14 cases), audit-log monthly dump with hash-chain integrity round-trip (gzip → upload → download → gunzip → chain-walk)
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions runs tests + syntax check + `npm audit` + ESLint on every push (lint enforcement added in v7.7.0 — fails on any warning)
- **ESLint** — `no-eval`, `no-implied-eval`, `no-new-func`, `eqeqeq` rules enforced

## Known Security Tradeoffs

The following are conscious design decisions, not oversights. Each represents a tradeoff between security hardening and product functionality.

### 1. CSP allows `unsafe-eval` (but NOT `unsafe-inline`)

**What:** The Content Security Policy permits `eval()` via `'unsafe-eval'` in scriptSrc. Inline scripts (`'unsafe-inline'`) have been **eliminated** as of v5.0.

**Why:** `unsafe-eval` is required by Chart.js 4.x which uses `new Function()` internally. Removing it would require replacing the charting library entirely.

**What was fixed (v5.0):** All 67 inline event handlers (`onclick=`, `onchange=`, etc.) across 12 files were converted to `addEventListener`. CSP `scriptSrc` no longer includes `'unsafe-inline'`, and `scriptSrcAttr` is set to `'none'`.

**Remaining:** `styleSrc` still allows `'unsafe-inline'` because inline `style="..."` attributes are used extensively and cannot be eliminated without a CSS-in-JS build step.

**Impact:** XSS via inline `<script>` injection is now blocked by CSP. XSS via `eval()` remains theoretically possible but requires an attacker to inject code that calls eval — mitigated by output escaping (`Utils.escapeHtml()`, 400+ usages).

**Mitigation:** Output escaping on all user-facing content. Helmet.js provides all other security headers. The application never calls `eval()` directly — only Chart.js does internally.

### 2. WebSocket accepts authentication token via query string

**What:** The WebSocket endpoint accepts the session token via `?token=` query parameter as a fallback when cookies are blocked.

**Why:** Some browsers (Edge with Tracking Prevention, Chrome with strict third-party cookie settings) block cookies on HTTP connections to IP addresses. Without the query param fallback, these users cannot use the real-time dashboard, terminal, or live logs.

**Impact:** Tokens in URLs can be exposed in server access logs, browser history, and referrer headers. OWASP recommends against passing sensitive data in URLs.

**Mitigation:** Cookie-based auth is always preferred — query param is only used when cookies fail. When query param auth is detected, it is logged at debug level for monitoring. HTTPS (via included Caddy config) encrypts the URL in transit. The token is a session token (not a permanent credential) with configurable TTL. **In `SECURITY_MODE=strict`, WebSocket query-string auth is completely disabled.**

### 3. Mixed authentication model (cookie + Bearer + API key)

**What:** The application accepts three authentication methods: session cookies (primary), Bearer tokens in Authorization header (API/CLI), and API keys (integrations).

**Why:** Session cookies are optimal for browser UI. Bearer tokens are needed for programmatic API access (scripts, CLI tools, monitoring). API keys enable long-lived integrations (Prometheus scraping, CI/CD webhooks).

**Impact:** More authentication paths means more surface area to secure. Each path must be independently validated and rate-limited.

**Mitigation:** Session cookies and Bearer tokens validate against the `sessions` table. API keys validate against a separate `api_keys` table with independent creation/revocation and **permission enforcement** (read-only keys are blocked from POST/PUT/DELETE by middleware). Rate limiting applies regardless of auth method. Audit log records the authentication method used. **In `SECURITY_MODE=strict`, the login response body omits the token entirely (cookie-only); Bearer and API key auth via Authorization header remain available by design.**

### 4. SSO header-based authentication

**What:** When `ENABLE_SSO_HEADERS=true`, the application trusts `X-Forwarded-User` headers to authenticate users without password verification.

**Why:** Common pattern for integration with Authelia, Authentik, Caddy forward_auth, and Traefik. These reverse proxies handle the actual authentication and inject the username header.

**Impact:** If the application is accidentally exposed without the trusted reverse proxy, an attacker can forge the header and authenticate as any user. This is the most operationally dangerous setting in Docker Dash.

**Mitigation:** Disabled by default (`ENABLE_SSO_HEADERS=false`). `.env.example` contains an explicit WARNING comment. Trust proxy is restricted to `loopback` in production. The feature is documented as requiring a trusted reverse proxy between the application and the internet.

### 5. Rate limiter backend depends on deployment mode

**What:** In **standalone mode (default)**, the HTTP rate limiter uses an in-memory `Map` — sliding-window semantics. In **HA mode (`DD_MODE=ha`, v6.17.0+)**, the rate limiter backs onto Redis `INCR` + `PEXPIRE` — fixed-window semantics, shared across all replicas.

**Why:** Zero external dependencies is the default positioning; standalone users get rate limiting without running Redis. HA deployments opt into Redis anyway (for leader election + pub/sub), and the rate-limiter win — enforcing limits across N replicas instead of `limit × N` effective — is free on top of the existing Redis.

**Impact:**
- **Standalone:** rate limits reset on process restart. In a single-replica deploy that's appropriate; restart is rare.
- **HA (fixed-window):** 2× theoretical burst at bucket boundaries compared to sliding-window standalone. Example: a `10 req/min` limit could allow up to 20 requests in a 2-second window spanning two buckets. Average case is identical; burst matters only for DDoS-class inputs which are not what an internal rate limiter is for anyway.
- **HA (Redis unreachable mid-request):** fail-open — request is allowed with a `warn` log. Prioritizes availability over strict enforcement. The rate limiter is a fair-use tool, not a security boundary.

**Mitigation:** Documented in [docs/features/ha-mode.md](docs/features/ha-mode.md#rate-limiter-semantics). Both modes implement the same API surface (`X-RateLimit-Remaining` response header, `Retry-After` on 429), so clients can't tell which backend is serving them. For target audiences (homelab standalone, corporate HA), both enforcement shapes are appropriate.

### 6. Docker socket access is inherently privileged

**What:** Docker Dash requires read access to the Docker socket to function.

**Why:** This is inherent to the entire category of Docker management tools (Portainer, Dockge, Lazydocker, etc.). There is no way to list/manage containers without socket access.

**Impact:** A compromised Docker Dash instance could potentially be used to escape to the host via Docker API. This is a structural limitation of all Docker management dashboards.

**Mitigation:** Socket mounted read-only (`:ro`) in production compose. `no-new-privileges` security option. Feature flags to disable dangerous operations (`ENABLE_EXEC=false`, `READ_ONLY_MODE=true`). Multi-user RBAC limits what each role can do. Audit trail on all actions.

### 7. Historical: moderate CVE `uuid <14.0.0` via `dockerode 4.x` — **CLOSED 2026-05-05**

**Status:** Closed. Upgraded to `dockerode 5.0.0` in the v8.2.x post-audit remediation pass. dockerode 5 dropped the `uuid` package entirely, so the transitive advisory ([GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq)) is no longer reachable. `npm audit --omit=dev` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**.

**Why the upgrade was non-breaking despite the major version bump:** dockerode 5.0.0's release notes (verified in advance) listed only "dropped uuid package, bumped minimum Node version requirement" as the breaking change. No public API changed. All 1356 tests passed without modification on first try.

**Kept here as historical record** so a future maintainer reading the audit history understands the rationale for the original "accepted" status and the path that closed it.

## Deployment Recommendations

| Deployment scenario | Mode | Suitability | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Homelab / personal | Standalone | **Excellent** | Ideal use case. Run behind HTTPS, generate strong secrets. |
| Small team / staging | Standalone + `--profile tls` | **Excellent** | Caddy handles HTTPS + Let's Encrypt. Use SSO if available (LDAP / Authelia / Authentik). |
| Production (internal, single-host) | Standalone | **Good** | Restrict network access, use TLS, disable exec if not needed. |
| Production (internal, high-availability) | **HA** (`DD_MODE=ha`) | **Good** — v7.0.0+ | 2-3 replicas + Redis + sticky-session LB. Leader election + cross-replica WS + Redis rate limiter. Followed by staging soak per the [failover runbook](docs/features/ha-failover-runbook.md). |
| Public internet | Standalone or HA | **Capable with caveats** | Must use HTTPS, strong secrets, and understand CSP trade-off (`unsafe-eval` for Chart.js). |
| Multi-tenant SaaS | — | **Not recommended** | Docker Dash assumes one organization per instance. No tenant isolation layer. |
| Geographic multi-region active-active | — | **Not supported** | SQLite single-writer limits HA to same-AZ. Would require a Postgres backend (not on current roadmap). |
